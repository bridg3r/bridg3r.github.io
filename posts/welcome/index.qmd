This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

I have been tasked with starting a blog as part of my senior project class. I really enjoy writing so I hope to put continue my blog after the class. As of late, I have noticed that at times I may not be an effective communicator when it comes to explaining code or mathematics. Can anyone else relate? I sometimes feel like my brain moves faster than my mouth can put my thoughts into words and then everything I say comes out sounding incoherent. Writing and blogging about what I learn can be a great way to improve my communication skills and my ability to put my thoughts into clear organized words.
